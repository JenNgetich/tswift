Tim McGraw
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said: Thats a lie
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin God that you werent here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
Its hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
And lookin back on all of that its nice to believe

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And Im back for the first time since then
Im standin on your street
And theres a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that youll read is:

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday youll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

Oh think of me
Mmmm

He said the way my blue eyes shine
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said: Thats a lie

Picture To Burn
State the obvious I didnt get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that Im obsessive and crazy
Thats fine you wont mind if I say
By the way


I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak
Whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as Im concerned youre
Just another picture to burn!

Theres no time for tears
Im just sitting here planning my revenge
Theres nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddys gonna show you how sorry youll be

And if youre missing me
Youd better keep it to yourself
Cause coming back around here
Would be bad for your health

Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak
Whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
In case you havent heard
I really really hate that

Burn burn burn baby burn
Youre just another picture to burn
Baby burn

Teardrops On My Guitar
Drew looks at me I fake a smile so he wont see
That I want and Im needing everything that we should be
Ill bet shes beautiful that girl he talks about
And shes got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me I laugh cause its just so funny
And I cant even see anyone when hes with me
He says hes so in love hes finally got it right
I wonder if he knows hes all I think about at night


Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Hes the song in the car I keep singing dont know why I do

Drew walks by me can he tell that I cant breathe
And there he goes so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know shes lucky cause

So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
Ill put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

Cause hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one whos got enough of me to break my heart
Hes the song in the car I keep singing dont know why I do
Hes the time taken up but theres never enough
And hes all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me I fake a smile so he wont see
A Place In This World
I dont know what I want so dont ask me
Cause Im still trying to figure it out
Dont know whats down this road Im just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though Im not the only one
Who feels the way I do

Im alone on my own and thats all I know
Ill be strong Ill be wrong oh but life goes on
Oh Im just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Got the radio on my old blue jeans
And Im wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrows just a mystery oh yeah
But thats ok

Maybe Im just a girl on a mission
But Im ready to fly

Im alone on my own and thats all I know
Ill be strong Ill be wrong oh but life goes on
Oh Im alone on my own and thats all I know
Oh Im just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Oh Im just a girl
Oh Im just a girl oh oh
Oh Im just a girl


Cold As You
You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take you take the very best of me
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want cause Im not what you wanted

Oh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away no use defending words that you will never say
And now that Im sitting here thinking it through
Ive never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

You never did give a damn thing honey but I cried cried for you
And I know you wouldnt have told nobody if I died died for you
(Died for you)

Oh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that Im sitting here thinking it through
Ive never been anywhere cold as you

The Outside
I didnt know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason I know
I didnt read between the lines
And baby Ive got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right

So how can I ever try to be better
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you this aint the best view
On the outside looking in
Ive been a lot of lonely places
Ive never been on the outside

You saw me there but never knew
I would give it all up to be
A part of this a part of you
And now its all too late so you see
You couldve helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until its too
Late to do anything



So how can I ever try to be better
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you this aint the best view
On the outside looking in
Ive been a lot of lonely places
Ive never been on the outside

Tied Together With A Smile
Seems the only one who doesnt see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking youre not pretty
But thats not true cause I know you

Hold on baby youre losing it
The waters high youre jumping into it
And letting go and no one knows
That you cry but you dont tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And youre tied together with a smile
But youre coming undone

I guess its true that love was all you wanted
Cause youre giving it away like its extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh cause its not his price to pay
Not his price to pay

Youre tied together with a smile
But youre coming undone oh
Goodbye baby
With a smile baby baby


Stay Beautiful
Corys eyes are like a jungle
He smiles its like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
These pretty girls on every corner
They watch him as hes walking home
Saying Does he know
Will you ever know

Youre beautiful
Every little piece love
And dont you know
Youre really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your love will lead you back to my door
Oh but if it dont
Stay beautiful

Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
Im taking pictures in my mind
So I can save them for a rainy day
Its hard to make a conversation
When hes taking my breath away
I should say hey by the way

If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
Ill never get to hold
At least youll know

Youre beautiful
Every little piece love
And dont you know
Youre really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your love lead you back to my front door
Oh but if it dont
Will you stay
Beautiful beautiful beautiful
Beautiful beautiful beautiful
La la la
Oh oh oh oh
Oh but if it dont
Stay beautiful
Stay beautiful
Na na na na na



Shouldve Said No
Its strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles the flowers everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you: feels wrong
You say that youd take it all back given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said Yes

You shouldve said No you shouldve gone home
You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
You shouldve know that word with what you did with her
Get back to me (get back to me)
And I shouldve been there in the back of your mind
I shouldnt be asking myself Why
You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You shouldve said no baby and you might still have me

You can see that Ive been crying
Baby you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same
You say that the past is the past you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said Yes

I cant resist
Before you go tell me this:
Was it worth it
Was she worth this

No no no no




Marys Song (Oh My My My)
She said I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes and said oh my my my

Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said youd beat me up you were bigger than me
You never did you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids you and I
Oh my my my my

Well I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasnt that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed wed really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said oh my my my

Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two AM riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside till the morning light
Oh my my my my

A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me got down on one knee

Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said I do and I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
Well rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time you and I

Ill be eighty-seven; youll be eighty-nine
Ill still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky oh my my my


Our Song
I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
Hes got a one-hand feel
On the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around turn the radio down
He says Baby is something wrong
I say Nothing
I was just thinking
How we dont have a song
And he says

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin out late tapping on your window
When were on the phone and you talk real slow
cause its late and your mama dont know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: Man I didnt kiss her when I should have
And when I got home  fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walking up
The front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong
And been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway
Well on my way
To my lovin bed
I almost didnt notice
All the roses
And the note that said

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin out late tapping on your window
When were on the phone and you talk real slow
cause its late and your mama dont know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: Man I didnt kiss her when I should have
And when I got home  fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

Ive heard every album listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin out late tapping on his window
When were on the phone and he talks real slow
cause its late and his mama dont know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: Man I didnt kiss him when I should have
And when I got home  fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again

Oh yeah
Oh-oh yeah

I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen
And an old napkin
And I wrote down our song

Im Only Me When Im With You
Friday night beneath the stars
in a field behind your yard
you and I are paintin pictures in the sky
And sometimes we dont say a thing;
just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I dont wanna live without you


Im only up when youre not down
Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
Its like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time;
the other half Im only trying to let you know that what I feel is true
And Im only me when Im with you

Just a small town boy and girl
livin in a crazy world
Tryin to figure out what is and isnt true
And I dont try to hide my tears
The secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do
And you know everything about me
You say that you cant live without me

When Im with anybody else its so hard to be myself
Only you can tell

That Im only up when youre not down
Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
Its like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time;
the other half Im only trying to let you know that what I feel is true
And Im only me
Who I wanna be
Well Im only me when Im with you
With you
Uh huh
Yeah



Invisible
She can’t see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She’ll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by

And you can’t see me wantin you the way you want her
But you are everything to me

I just wanna show you
She don’t even know you
Shes never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
If you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

There’s a fire inside of you
That can’t help but shine through
She’s never gonna see the light
No matter what you do

And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be

Like shadows in a faded light
Oh we’re invisible
I just wanna open your eyes
And make you realize

I just wanna show you
She don’t even know you
Baby let me love you
Let me want you
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

She can’t see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
A Perfectly Good Heart

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apartnow
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart

Maybe I shouldve seen the signs shouldve read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say I still cant believe
That you would walk away
It dont make sense to me but:

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart

Its not unbroken anymore
How do I get it back the way it was before

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apartnow
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break would you wanna break a:

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart

Jump Then Fall

Were on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound

Forever & Always (Piano Version)
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down we almost never speak
I dont feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened please tell me
Cause one second it was perfect
Now youre half way out the door

And I stare at the phone
He still hasnt called
And then you feel so low
You cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When he said forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here
And it rains when youre gone
I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew for a minute now Im not so sure
So heres to everything coming down to nothing
Heres to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going
Thought I knew for a minute but I dont anymore

And I stare at the phone
He still hasnt called
And then you feel so low
You cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When he said forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here
And it rains when youre gone
I was there when you said forever and always

You didnt mean it baby
I dont this so oh oh oh
Back up baby back up
Did you forget everything
Back up baby back up
Did you forget everything

Back up baby back up
Please back up oh back up
Back up baby back up

Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here
And it rains when youre gone
I was there when you said forever and always

And I stare at the phone
He still hasnt called
And then you feel so low
You cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When we said forever and always
Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here
And it rains when youre gone
I was there when you said forever and always

You didnt mean it baby
You said forever and always yeah
Come In With The Rain
I could go back to every laugh
But I dont wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I dont wanna go there anymore

Talk to the wind talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find

I’ll leave my window open
‘Cause I’m too tired at night to call your name
Just know I’m right here hopin’
That you’ll come in with the rain

I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don’t wanna’ have to go that far
And I I’ve got you down
I know you by heart
And you don’t even know where I start

Talk to yourself talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don’t wait for the sky to clear

I’ll leave my window open
‘Cus I’m too tired at night to call your name
Oh just know I’m right here hopin’
That you’ll come in with the rain

I’ve watched you so long
Screamed your name
I don’t know what else I can say

But I’ll leave my window open
‘Cus I’m too tired at night for all these games
Just know I’m right here hopin’
That you’ll come in with the rain

I could go back to every laugh
But I don’t wanna’ go there anymore…


Superstar
This is wrong but I cant help but feel like
There aint nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I cant
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
Id be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and
All the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight tell me things like
I cant take my eyes off of you
Im no one special just another
Wide eyed girl whos desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar

Good morning loneliness comes around when Im not
Dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
Youll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face Id be
Counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and
All the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight tell me things like
I cant take my eyes off of you
Im no one special just another
Wide eyed girl whos desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar

You played in bars you play guitar
Im invisible and everyone knows who you are
And youll never see sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

So dim that spotlight tell me things like
I cant take my eyes off of you
Im no one special just another
Wide eyed girl whos desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar
Sweet sweet superstar superstar
The Other Side Of The Door
In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay
I said This time Ive had enough
And youve called a hundred times
But Im not picking up
Cause Im so mad I might tell you that its over
But if you look a little closer

I said Leave but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming Im in love with you
Wait there in the pouring rain come back for more
And dont you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door and all the things that I misread 
So babe if you know everything tell me why you couldnt see
When I left I wanted you to chase after me

Yeah I said Leave but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming Im in love with you
Wait there in the pouring rain come back for more
And dont you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

And Ill scream out the window
I cant even look at you
I dont need you but I do I do I do
I say Theres nothing you can say to make this right
I mean it I mean it
What I mean is

I said Leave but baby all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming Im in love with you
Wait there in the pouring rain come back for more
And dont you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carry me from your car to the stairs
And I broke down crying was she worth this mess
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess I need you


Fearless
Theres somethin bout the way
The street looks when its just rained
Theres a glow off the pavement
you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah
Oh yeah

Were drivin down the road
I wonder if you know
Im tryin so hard not to get caught up now
But youre just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent mindedly makin me want you

And I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

So baby drive slow
til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passengers seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it remember it

Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Well you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake
Im not usually this way but
You pull me in and Im a little more brave
Its the first kiss
Its flawless
Really something
Its fearless

Oh yeah
Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Cuz I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Oh-oh
Oh yeah
Fifteen
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
Its the morning of your very first day
You say Hi to your friends you aint seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybodys way
Its your freshman year and youre gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
You know I havent seen you around before

Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Youre gonna believe them
And when youre fifteen
Feeling like theres nothing to figure out
Well count to ten take it in
This is life before you know who youre gonna be
Fifteen

You sit in class next to a redheaded Abigail
And soon enough youre best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think theyre so cool
Well be out of here as soon as we can
And then youre on your very first date and hes got a car
And youre feeling like flying
And your mammas waiting up
and youre thinking hes the one
And youre dancing round the room when the night ends when the night ends

Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Youre gonna believe them
When youre fifteen and your first kiss makes your head spin around
But in your life youll do things greater than dating the boy of the football team
But I didnt know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Youre gonna believe them
And when youre fifteen dont forget to look before you fall
Ive found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who youre supposed to be
I didnt know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la

Your very first day
You take a deep breath girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
Love Story
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts:
Im standing there on a balcony in summer air

See the lights see the party the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say Hello
Little did I know

That you were Romeo you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you Please dont go
And I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting; all thats left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story baby just say Yes

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet cause were dead if they knew
So close your eyes escape this town for a little while
Oh oh

Cause you were Romeo  I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you Please dont go
And I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting; all thats left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story baby just say Yes

Romeo save me theyre trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult but its real
Dont be afraid well make it out of this mess
Its a love story baby just say Yes

Oh oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said

Romeo save me Ive been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head I dont know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

Marry me Juliet youll never have to be alone
I love you and thats all I really know
I talked to your dad  go pick out a white dress
Its a love story baby just say Yes

Oh oh oh oh oh

Cause we were both young when I first saw you
Hey Stephen
Hey Stephen
I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked
We were talking 
I didnt say half the things I wanted to

Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
Ill be the one waiting there even when its cold
Hey Stephen
Boy you might have me believing
I dont always have to be alone

Cause I cant help it if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself

Hey Stephen
Ive been holding back this feeling
So Ive got some things to say to you ha
I seen it all 
So I thought 
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do

The way you walk way you talk way you say my name 
Its beautiful wonderful dont you ever change
Hey Stephen
Why are people always leaving
I think you and I should stay the same

Theyre dimming the street lights
Youre perfect for me why arent you here tonight
Im waiting alone now so come on and come out and pull me near to shine shine shine

Hey Stephen
I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls 
Well theyre beautiful
But would they write a song for you

I cant help it if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself
if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself

Myself
Cant help myself
I cant help myself

You Belong With Me
Youre on the phone with your girlfriend  shes upset
Shes going off about something that you said
Cause she doesnt get your humor like I do

Im in the room  its a typical Tuesday night
Im listening to the kind of music she doesnt like
And shell never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts
I wear t-shirts
Shes cheer captain
And Im on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what youre looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see
That Im the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So why cant you see 
You belong with me
You belong with me

Walking the streets with you in your worn out jeans
I cant help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
Hey isnt this easy

And youve got a smile
That can light up this whole town
I havent seen it in awhile
Since she brought you down

You say youre fine  I know you better than that
Hey what you doing with a girl like that

She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
Shes cheer captain
And Im on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what youre looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see
That Im the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So why cant you see 
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know baby 
You belong with me
You belong with me

[Instrumental]

Oh I remember you were driving to my house
In the middle of the night
Im the one who makes you laugh
When you know youre bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know its with me

Cant you see
That Im the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So why cant you see 
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know baby 
You belong with me
You belong with me

You belong with me

Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me

You belong with me

Breathe
I see your face in my mind as I drive away 
Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way 
People are people 
And sometimes we change our minds 
But its killing me to see you go after all this time 

Mmm mmm mmm 
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm 
Mmm mmm mmm 
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm 

Music starts playin like the end of a sad movie 
Its the kinda ending you dont really wanna see 
Cause its tragedy and itll only bring you down 
Now I dont know what to be without you around 

And we know its never simple 
Never easy 
Never a clean break noone here to save me 
Youre the only thing I know like the back of my hand 
And I cant 
Breathe 
Without you 
But I have to 
Breathe 
Without you 
But I have to 

Never wanted this never wanna see you hurt 
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve 
But people are people 
And sometimes it doesnt work out 
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out 

And we know its never simple 
Never easy 
Never a clean break no one here to save me 
Youre the only thing I know like the back of my hand 
And I cant 
Breathe 
Without you 
But I have to 
Breathe 
Without you 
But I have to 

Its two am 
Feelin like I just lost a friend 
Hope you know its not easy 
Easy for me 
Its two am 
Feelin like I just lost a friend 
Hope you know this aint easy 
Easy for me 

And we know its never simple 
Never easy 
Never a clean break noone here to save me 

Ohhh 

I cant 
Breathe 
Without you 
But I have to 
Breathe 
Without you 
But I have to 

Sorry (oh) Sorry (mmm) 
Sorry (eh eh) Sorry (mmm) 
Sorry (eh eh) Sorry (mmm) 
Sorry

Tell Me Why
I took a chance I took a shot 
And you might think im bulletproof but im not 
You took a swing I took it hard 
And down here from the ground I see who you are 

Im sick and tired of your attitude 
Im feeling like I dont know you 
You tell me that you love me then you cut me down 
And I need you like a heartbeat 
But you know you got a mean streak 
Makes me run for cover when youre around 
And heres to you and your temper 
Yes I remember what you said last night 
And I know that you see what youre doing to me 
Tell me why 

You could write a book on how to ruin someones perfect day 
Well I get so confused and frustrated 
Forget what im trying to say oh 

Im sick and tired of your reasons 
I got no one to believe in 
You tell me that you want me then push me around 
And I need you like a heartbeat 
But you know you got a mean streak 
Makes me run for cover when youre around 
Heres to you and your temper 
Yes I remember what you said last night 
And I know that you see what youre doing to me 
Tell me why 

Whydo you have to make me feel small 
So you can feel whole inside 
Whydo you have to put down my dreams 
So youre the only thing on my mind 

Im sick and tired of your attitude 
Im feeling like I dont know you 
You tell me that you want me then cut me down 
Im sick and tired of your reasons 
Ive got no one to believe in 
You ask me for my love then you push me around 
Heres to you and your temper 
Yes I remember what you said last night 
And I know that you see what youre doing to me 
Tell me why 
Why tell me why 

I take a step back let you go 
I told you im not bulletproof 
Now you know

Youre Not Sorry
All this time I was wasting
Hoping you would come around
Ive been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And its taking me this long
Baby but I figured you out
And youre thinking well be fine again
But not this time around

You dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Dont wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you baby
Like I did - before
Youre not sorry no no oh

Looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didnt know
Couldve loved you all my life
If you hadnt left me waiting in the cold
And you got your share of secrets
And Im tired of being last to know
And now youre asking me to listen
Cause its worked each time before

But you dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Dont wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you baby
Like I did - before
Youre not sorry no no oh

Youre not sorry no no oh

You had me crawling for you honey
And it never wouldve gone away no
You used to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade

So you dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Theres nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you baby
Like I did - before
Youre not sorry no no oh

Youre not sorry no no oh

The Way I Loved You
He is sensible and so incredible 
And all my single friends are jealous 
He says everything I need to hear and its like 
I couldnt ask for anything better 
He opens up my door and I get into his car 
And he says you look beautiful tonight 
And I feel perfectly fine 

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
And its 2am and Im cursing your name 
Youre so in love that you act insane 
And thats the way I loved you 
Breakin down and coming undone 
Its a roller coaster kinda rush 
And I never knew I could feel that much 
And thats the way I loved you 

He respects my space 
And never makes me wait 
And he calls exactly when he says he will 
Hes close to my mother 
Talks business with my father 
Hes charming and endearing 
And Im comfortable 

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
And its 2am and Im cursing your name 
Youre so in love that you act insane 
And thats the way I loved you 
Breakin down and coming undone 
Its a roller coaster kinda rush 
And I never knew I could feel that much 
And thats the way I loved you 

He cant see the smile Im faking 
And my hearts not breaking 
Cause Im not feeling anything at all 
And you were wild and crazy 
Just so frustrating intoxicating 
Complicated got away by some mistake and now 

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
Its 2am and Im cursing your name 
Im so in love that I acted insane 
And thats the way I loved you 
Breaking down and coming undone 
Its a roller coaster kinda rush 
And I never knew I could feel that much 
And thats the way I loved you oh oh 

And thats the way I loved you oh oh 
Never knew I could feel that much 
And thats the way I loved you

Forever & Always
Once upon a time I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me

Were you just kidding
cause it seems to me this thing is breaking down
We almost never speak
I dont feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened please tell me

cause one second it was perfect now youre halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute now Im not so sure

So heres everything coming down to nothing
Heres to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going Thought I knew for a minute but I dont anymore

And I stare at the phone he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didnt mean it baby I dont think so

Back up baby back up
Did you forget everything
Back up baby back up
Did you forget everything

cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
cause I was there when you said forever and always

Oh I stare at the phone he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always

And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didnt mean it baby you said forever and always yeah


The Best Day
Im five years old
Its getting cold
Ive got my big coat on

I hear your laugh
And look up smiling at you
I run and run

Past the pumpkin patch
And the tractor rides
Look now -- the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep
On the way home

I dont know why all the trees change in the fall
I know youre not scared of anything at all
Dont know if Snow Whites house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day
With you today

Im thirteen now
And dont know how my friends
Could be so mean

I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys

And we drive and drive
Until weve found a town
Far enough away

And we talk and window-shop
Until Ive forgotten all their names

I dont know who Im gonna talk to
Now at school
I know Im laughing on the car ride home with you
Dont know how long its gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day
With you today

I have an excellent father
His strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
Inside and out
Hes better than I am

I grew up in a pretty house
And I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

There is a video
I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen
And youre talking to me

Its the age of princesses and pirate ships
And the seven dwarfs
Daddys smart
And youre the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side
Even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
Staying back and watching me shine

And I didnt know if you knew
So Im taking this chance to say
That I had the best day
With you today
Change
And it’s a sad picture the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it’s all the same another time and place
Repeating history and you’re getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I’ll do anything to see it through

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution the time will come
For us to finally win
And we’ll sing hallelujah we’ll sing hallelujah

So we’ve been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
It’s hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair
We’re getting stronger now
Find things they never found
They might be bigger
But we’re faster and never scared
You can walk away say we don’t need this
But there’s something in your eyes
Says we can beat this

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution the time will come
For us to finally win
And we’ll sing hallelujah well sing hallelujah

Tonight we stand get off our knees
Fight for what we’ve worked for all these years
And the battle was long it’s the fight of our lives
But we’ll stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed
Can you see it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It’s a revolution throw your hands up
Cause we never gave in
And we sang hallelujah we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah
